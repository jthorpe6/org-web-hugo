#+title: org-web-hugo

I was looking into how I could display a bunch of =org-mode= documents nicely, yes a good =emacs= setup helps, but sometimes you just want to view them in the web. So I started looking around, and turns out [[https://gohugo.io][hugo]] supports =org-mode= by default. So I made a simple =Dockerfile=.

* Usage
Clone and build the container 

#+begin_src shell :results output
  git clone https://github.com/jthorpe6/org-web-hugo && \
      cd org-web-hugo && \
      docker build -t org-web-hugo .
#+end_src

When you have built the container, you can then run it with the command

#+begin_src shell :results output
  docker run \
	 --rm \
	 -d \
	 -p 1313:1313 \
	 -v /path/to/folder/of/.org/files:/org-web-hugo/content/posts \
	 org-web-hugo
#+end_src

Once the container is running, browse to http://localhost:1313

** Changing the theme

 Change this line in the =Dockerfile= to whatever theme you want

 #+begin_src dockerfile
   RUN git init && \
     git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke && \
     echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
 #+end_src

For example

#+begin_src dockerfile
  RUN git init && \
    git submodule add https://github.com/surajmandalcell/potato-dark themes/potato-dark && \
    echo "theme = 'potato-dark'" >> hugo.toml
#+end_src

Sometimes in testing themes I found I was missing assets, in that case add another step to copy those.
